== Installing

Having a "Installing" section is a bit of a chicken or egg question.
Someone reading this README has, in all likelyhood already installed the
package. 

 You can install the +tlv+ package by executing:

	gem install tlv -r

alternatively, you can download +.tar.gz+ or +.zip+ archives from 
Rubyforge[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=2203].


== Mail

In case you discover bugs, spelling errors, offer suggestions for
improvements or would like to help out with the project, you can contact
me directly (tim@kuriositaet.de).
